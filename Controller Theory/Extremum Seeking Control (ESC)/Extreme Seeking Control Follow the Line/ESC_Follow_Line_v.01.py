""" 
Code Name: Extremum Seeking Control Follow Line Test
Version: 01
Objective:
    For the robot to follow a straight line. The line represents a signal. 
    The purpose is for the robot to detect a sound and adjust its location accordingly.
    
[Perturbation]:
A controlled disturbance or oscillation applied to a system's input. 
This technique aids in estimating the gradient of the cost function 
and enables adaptive control by allowing the system to explore how changes in input affect output.

[Adaptive Control]:
Purpose: By using perturbation, the controller can adaptively adjust its inputs based on real-time feedback, 
helping the robot minimize the cost and align with the target line.
